1. Use case tells you what the business does.

2. ER Model outlines *the things* the business needs to remember in order to fufill the use cases.

	Use "Peter Chen Notation" or verbal form

Entity Relationship Concepts:
	An ER Model shows the connection between *Entity-types*. 

	For example the statement "A President gives a Speech" shows that the President and Speech entity-types are related by the former "giving" the latter.

	An Entity is a unique instance of an Entity-type. For example Obama is a President and Innauguration Address is a Speech. So you can say "Obama gives an Innauguration Address". But in business we are interested in capturing the general case, that is why ER Models deal with Entity-types not Entites. This distinction is important.

	But computer scientist are lazy and smart, so they simply say Entity while Entity-types is meant.

	Entity-type: a noun like a physical object, an event, or a concept
	Relationship: a transitive verb; what an entity-type does to another entity-type

		Example: 
			A Student writes an Exam
				Entity-types = Student and Exam
				Relationship = writes

	> Transitive verbs require 1 or more objects: for instance "A Soldier *carries* a Gun". The verb *carries* takes the object Gun.
